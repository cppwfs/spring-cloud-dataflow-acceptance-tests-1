= Spring Cloud Data Flow Acceptance Tests - Tests =

This script builds and runs the tests in the `src` directory using `mvn test`.
This includes clean up by default.
Cleanup can be disabled by setting -c  | --skipCleanup.

NOTE: This requires the environment to be properly installed and configured, typically by running `run.sh setup` first.
Platform specific environment variables must also be set.

== How to run it

`tests.sh`  must be run from the project root. The easiest way is:

```
./run.sh tests <args>
```

which simply invokes `tests.sh` with the given args.
Alternately, you can run it standalone from the project root:
```
./scripts/tests.sh <args>
```

```
USAGE: tests.sh -p <PLATFORM> -b <BINDER> [-pf -se -cc -av- tv -c -sc --tests ...]
  Run the acceptance tests.

Flags:
    -p  | --platform - define the target platform to run, defaults to local
    -pf | --platformFolder - folder containing the scripts for installing the platform. Defaults to 'platform'
    -b  | --binder - define the binder (i.e. RABBIT, KAFKA) defaults to RABBIT
    --tests - comma separated list of tests to run. Wildcards such as *http* are allowed (e.g. --tests TickTockTests#tickTockTests)
    -cc | --skipCloudConfig - skip Cloud Config server tests for CF
    -se | --schedulesEnabled - run scheduling tests.
    -av | --appsVersion - set the stream app version to test (e.g. Celsius.SR2). Apps should be accessible via maven repo or docker hub.
    -tv | --tasksVersion - set the task app version to test (e.g. Elston.RELEASE). Tasks should be accessible via maven repo or docker hub.
    -c  | --skipCleanup - skip the clean up phase
    -sc | --serverCleanup - run the cleanup for only SCDF and Skipper, along with the applications deployed but excluding the DB, message broker.
    -hs | --httpsEnabled - uses HTTPS urls to connect to deployed Stream and Task apps (k8s only).
```
